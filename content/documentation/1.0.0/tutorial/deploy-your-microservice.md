# Deploy Your Microservice
In this step we'll learn how to deploy our newly created microservice to our ioFog tutorial environment.

## Register Your Docker Image
With our Docker image from the previous step in hand, it's time to publish it to a [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/).

While you can use a custom registry (or the public [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)), the Controller also comes with a built-in private registry that represents the local cache on the ioFog edge compute nodes.

Open up a bash session into our iofog-controller container:

```sh
docker exec -ti iofog-controller bash
```

Now to get a list of the container registries, we can use `registry list`:

```sh
iofog-controller registry list
```

You should see two, the first being [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), but we're going to use the second one, which is the built-in private registry:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "url": "from_cache",
  "isPublic": true,
  "isSecure": true,
  "certificate": "",
  "requiresCert": false,
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "userEmail": "",
  "userId": null
}
```

The unique ID for the built-in registry is always `2`.

Now that we have that registry ID, we can use it to add our Docker image to its catalog. We'll provide `yourname/moving-average:v1` as the x86-image of our microservice:

```sh
# registry ID 2 is the internal private one provided by ioFog
iofog-controller catalog add \
  --name "Moving Average" \
  --x86-image yourname/moving-average:v1 \
  --arm-image yourname/moving-average:v1 \
  --registry-id 2 \
  --user-id 1
```

This command will return a catalog ID that we'll use in the next step.

## Add Your Microservice
Now that the Docker image containing our microservice code is registered, we can spin up new copies of it also using the Controller.

Instantiating a new microservice is done using the `microservice add` command. We need to provide several options, the most notable being the catalog ID we received in the previous section as well as a node IDâ€”which is the ID of the edge node we want this microservice to run on.

So let's find the `"uuid"` field for the first Agent with the name "Agent 1":

```sh
iofog-controller iofog list
```

Using that ID, we can pass it and our other arguments to instantiate the microservice:

```sh
iofog-controller microservice add \
  --name "Moving Average 1" \
  --catalog-id 16 \
  --config '{ "maxWindowSize": 10 }' \
  --iofog-id zYr9DZCMhwTrxmFgkbTH9rZqnpgvxbNj \
  --flow-id 1 \
  --user-id 1
```

This is also a great opportunity to include our custom config for our `maxWindowSize`.

This command will return the microservice ID, which we'll then use in the next step to setup our routes.

## Setup Our Routes
With the microservice ID from the last step, let's change our routes so that our new microservice is placed between the Sensors and the REST API.

First, let's remove the old route from the Sensors to the REST API. We need to retrieve the microservice IDs for Sensors and the REST API:

```sh
iofog-controller microservice list
```

After finding those two IDs in the list, provide them as the `route-remove --route` argument in the format `source:dest`, separated by a semi-colon with no spaces. In this case, the Sensor's ID is the source, and the REST API's ID is the destination.

```sh
iofog-controller microservice route-remove \
  --route <sensors_id>:<rest_api_id>
```

```sh
iofog-controller microservice route-remove \
  --route 2V3NyFFxM8WkNcnbWFvn38PFRJT2GqJg:gwzQJ4mcTTLyJgdLZJHkKmbQqJFpBDtq
```

Now we need to place two new routes: one from the Sensors to Moving Average, and another from Moving Average to the REST API; this places our new microservice in between them.

iofog-controller microservice route-create \
  --route 2V3NyFFxM8WkNcnbWFvn38PFRJT2GqJg:H8Fg3f38qVn4ZyF2dFYwVCJb9j8RpfJz

iofog-controller microservice route-create \
  --route H8Fg3f38qVn4ZyF2dFYwVCJb9j8RpfJz:gwzQJ4mcTTLyJgdLZJHkKmbQqJFpBDtq

```sh
# Sensors -> Moving Average
iofog-controller microservice route --add \
  --source-microservice-id <sensors_id>  \
  --dest-microservice-id <moving_average_id>

# Moving Average -> REST API
iofog-controller microservice route --add \
  --source-microservice-id <moving_average_id>  \
  --dest-microservice-id <rest_api_id>
```

Now for the moment of truth. Let's first try a curl request to our REST API:

```sh
curl http://localhost:10101/
```

If everything is working correctly, the JSON returned should be our new moving averages and contain our `"isAverage": true` field we added.

We can also open up the [Freeboard dashboard](http://localhost:10102/?load=dashboard.json) to view the averaged values!

## Update a Microservice
Once a microservice is up and running you will probably need to modify it later, which we can also do with the Controller.

The `microservice update` command is used to update a particular microservice:

```sh
iofog-controller microservice update \
  --microservice-id <id> \
  --config '{ "maxWindowSize": 100 }' \
```

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've now have the fundamentals of ioFog. Once you're feeling more comfortable you can create a blank [Development Environment](quick-start) locally, or start setting up [ioFog in production](setup-your-controllers).
